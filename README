The solution is implemented using Play framework. The Play framework utilizes SBT as a build tool.
To compile and run provided solution SBT needs to be installed first.

Installation instructions
=========================

1. Install SBT from the following link: http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html
2. Clone source code for the FizzBuzz service from GitHub:
   git clone git@github.com:vshpurik/fizzbuzz.git
3. From command line change directory to fizzbuzz
4. Compile project with the following command:
   sbt compile
5. To open project in eclipse, first generate ecplise progect configuration files:
   sbt eclipse 
 
   After that, start eclipse and open project from the fizzbuzz directory.

Execution instructions
======================

Start web server with the following command:
   sbt run

Server will listen for http requests on port 9000. There are two valid URLs:
1. localhost:9000
2. localhost:9000/fizzbuzz/N - where N is any integer number

Automated Tests
===============

There are three test classes to perform unit and integration testing. These classes are located in the test directory.
Integration tests are located in the test/controllers sub directory, and unit tests are located in the 
test/models sub directory.

To execute all tests, run the following command:
sbt test
